Page Layout techniques
There are two types of tags:
1.Semantic Tags
2.Non Semantic Tags
We use semantic tags for page layout e.g: <header> <footer> <main>.The benefit of using semantic tags is to make the code structured/readable.
Use of semantic tags (vanilla html) helps in ranking of page (SEO optimization).
Non Semantic Tag's definition is not clear by its name for e.g: <div> <span>
------------------------------------------------------------INSIDE MAIN TAG <main>--------------------------------------------------------
We use three tags:
<section> tag is used for a section for your page
<article> tag is used for an article for your page
<aside> tag is used for content aside main content (ads) SEO does not detect aside tag as the conent inside this tag is an ad
PUTTING A LINK INSIDE AN IMAGE (CLICKABLE IMAGE)
For e.g: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_main"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wiksvg.png" height="100" alt="Fb"> </a>
-------------------------------------------DIV Tag------------------------------------
<div> tag is a container used for other html elements,by default the height of div is 0 when it contains no element
Block element (takes full width) Whole screen's width is taken by them
INLINE elements takes the space which is required by them working in an efficient manner.
<div style="background-color: red;"> <p> Hello World </p></div> (DIV is a block element)
Div is helpful when we have to make changes in a lot of elements collectivley 
------------------------------------------SPAN TAG--------------------------------------
<span> tag is used as a container for other html tags
<span> tag is an inline element which takes width as per size

List in html are used to represent real life list data
There are two types of lists ordered and unordered
1. Ordered list (data will be represented in bullet points. <ul> </ul>
2. Unordered list (data will be represented in numbered list. for e.g: 1,2,3 a,b,c i,ii,iii  <ol> </ol>
<ul> 
<li>  Ali </li>
    <ul> 
        <li> Grade: A </li>
         <li> Section: G </li>
    </ul>
<li> Maaz </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> Grade: B </li>
      <li> Section: H </li>
      </ul>
</ul>
The above method is for creating unordered list and its sublists
<ol> 
<li>  Ali </li>
    <ul> 
        <li> Grade: A </li>
         <li> Section: G </li>

---------------------------Tables in HTMl--------------------------
Tables are used to represent real life tabular data in html webpage
<tr>  is used to display table row

        <label for="102">
        <input type="radio" name="class" value="classXII" id="102"> ClassXII
